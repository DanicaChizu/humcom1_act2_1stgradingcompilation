            Birds of Prey (and the Fantabulous Emancipation of One Harley Quinn) is a 2020 American superhero film based on the DC Comics team the Birds of Prey. Distributed by Warner Bros. Pictures, it is the eighth installment in the DC Extended Universe (DCEU) and a spin-off/sequel to Suicide Squad (2016). It was directed by Cathy Yan and written by Christina Hodson, and it stars Margot Robbie, Mary Elizabeth Winstead, Jurnee Smollett-Bell, Rosie Perez, Chris Messina, Ella Jay Basco, Ali Wong, and Ewan McGregor. The film follows Harley Quinn, after breaking up with the Joker, joining forces with Helena Bertinelli, Dinah Lance, and Renee Montoya to save Cassandra Cain from Gotham City crime lord Roman Sionis, forming the Birds of Prey altogether.

            Birds of Prey is the first DCEU film and the second DC Films production to be rated R by the Motion Picture Association of America, following Joker (2019). The film had its world premiere in Mexico City on January 25, 2020, and was theatrically released in the United States in IMAX, Dolby Cinema, ScreenX and 4DX on February 7, 2020. It grossed $201 million worldwide, making it the tenth highest-grossing film of 2020 but falling short of its widely reported break even point of $250â€“300 million. The film received mostly positive reviews from critics for its visual style, Yan's direction, and Robbie's performance, but criticism towards Hodson's screenplay. </p>
